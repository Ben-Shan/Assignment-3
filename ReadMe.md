Our aim for this assignment is to create an application in which the user can play a song
and the application will display audio in a graphical format using the beat and fequency
of the chosen song.
If we successfully complete this, the main aspect of the assignment, we will then move on 
to allowing the user to choose preferences such as colour, shape and design from GUI.
